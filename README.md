# Python Vintage Chats
______________________________________________
This is a Live Chatting application that has no UI/UX whatsoever. We can send and receive messages from the terminal asynchronously, meaning the `sending` and `receiving` processes perform asynchronously with each other. We can send message and at the same time also receive messages without user interaction. 

## Requirements and Modules
1. You can explicitly Install all the modules required using the following command
````python
pip install colorama
pip install mysql-connector-python
````
2. Or you can use the `requirements.txt` file to install the modules (Command is mentioned below)
````python
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
Once the installation is done, follow up to the second step namely Usage

## Usage
First, we need to execute chat.py with the command
````python
python chat.py # For Unix python3 chat.py
````
Then we can log in.

This Chat.py file shows all the messages so far with the user you will choose in Sender.py File
Once all the processes asked have been done, You can now execute the Sender.py file
This is used to send messages to respective users.
